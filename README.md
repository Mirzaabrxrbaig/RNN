## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network** for forecasting sequential time-series data.

The notebook demonstrates:
- Synthetic time-series data generation
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Sliding-window sequence creation
- Training an LSTM deep learning model
- Evaluating predictions using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² metrics
